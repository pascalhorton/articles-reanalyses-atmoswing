	%The analogue method is a statistical downscaling method for precipitation prediction. It uses similarity in terms of synoptic-scale predictors with situations in the past in order to provide a probabilistic prediction for the day of interest. It has been used for decades in a context of weather or flood forecasting, and is more recently also applied to climate studies, whether for reconstruction of past weather conditions or future climate impact studies. In order to evaluate the relationship between synoptic scale predictors and the local weather variable of interest, e.g. precipitation, reanalysis datasets are necessary. Nowadays, the number of available reanalysis datasets increase. These are generated by different atmospheric models with different assimilation techniques and offer various spatial and temporal resolutions. A major difference between these datasets is also the length of the archive they provide. While some datasets start at the beginning of the satellite era and assimilate these data, others aim at homogeneity on a longer period and only assimilate conventional observations.
%The context of the application of analogue methods might drive the choice of an appropriate dataset, for example when the archive length is a leading criterion. However, in many studies, a reanalysis dataset is subjectively chosen, according to the user’s preferences or the ease of access. The impact of this choice on the results of the downscaling procedure is rarely considered and no comprehensive comparison has been undertaken so far.
%In order to fill this gap and to advise on the choice of appropriate datasets, nine different global reanalysis datasets were compared in seven distinct versions of analogue methods, over 300 precipitation stations in Switzerland. Significant differences in terms of prediction performance were identified. Although the impact of the reanalysis dataset on the skill score varies according to the chosen predictor, be it atmospheric circulation or thermodynamic variables, some hierarchy between the datasets is often preserved.

\section{Introduction}

Statistical downscaling is widely used to bridge the resolution gap between climate model outputs and impact models, and to bias-correct them. Several of these methods consist in establishing an empirical statistical relationship between large-scale atmospheric variables and the local variable of interest. Following the classification of \citet{Rummukainen1997} also used in \citet{Maraun2010}, there are basically two types of approaches: perfect prognosis, for which the relationship is calibrated on large-scale and local-scale observations, and model output statistics, for which the relationship is calibrated on model outputs for the large-scale variables and local-scale observations. In the context of perfect prognosis approaches, large-scale observations are thus needed. Global meteorological reanalyses are very useful to fulfil this role, as they provide gridded large-scale variables available at any location of the world.

Reanalyses are produced with a single version of a data assimilation system with a forecast model constrained to follow at best the observations over a long period. They provide multivariate outputs that are physically consistent, and that contain information in locations where few or no observations are available, also for variables that are not directly observed \citep{Gelaro2017}. Their accuracy depends on both the quality of the model physics and that of the analysis process, and thus indirectly of the quantity and quality of the assimilated observations \citep{Dee2011a}. The homogeneity of a reanalysis is a challenge due to significant changes in observing systems. For example, the availability of satellite observations drastically changed the amount of data available, particularly for regions with sparse conventional observation networks. The assimilation of an variable amount of observations is likely to lead to inhomogeneities in the reanalysis. For this reason, some reanalyses are either limited to the satellite era, or, if the period of interest expands before 1980, they might not use satellite observations. Because of these issues, some variables, such as precipitation and evaporation are to be used with great caution \citep{Kobayashi2015}.

In perfect prognosis methods, these reanalyses are considered as observations of the large-scale variables. As the statistical relationship established using reanalyses is afterwards applied to outputs from other models, the variables considered as predictors should not strongly depend on the model used and should be as robust as possible, so that they are mainly influenced by the observations only.

The present work focuses on the analogue method (AM), which is a statistical downscaling technique relying on the hypothesis that similar synoptic situations are likely to result in similar local effects, plus a certain variability that is not explained by the considered predictors \citep{Lorenz1969}. The variable of interest is here precipitation. In order to take into account this uncertainty, several analogue days are extracted from the archive to provide the empirical conditional distribution that is the statistical prediction for the considered target day. Different versions of AMs exist, relying on various predictors. However, they generally all contain a predictor describing the atmospheric circulation.

In one of the first version of the AM, the predictors were extracted from radio-sounding data \citep{Duband1981}, which involved heavy pre-treatment to have a complete and homogeneous database that can be used. Other authors worked with rather short local analysis from forecast models \cite[for example][]{Kruizinga1983, VandenDool1989}. The release of the first reanalysis dataset \citep[NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I, NR-1,][]{Kalnay1996, Kistler2001} greatly simplified the implementation of the AM, and opened new opportunities of using other variables that were not available before. This increased the popularity of the method \citep{Timbal2008a}.

\citet{Timbal2003} and \citet{Bontron2004} were the first authors to use NR-1 in the AM. As NR-1 remained a popular dataset for a long time, this dataset or its updated version NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 \citep[NR-2,][]{Kanamitsu2002} were often used until recently \citep{Wetterhall2005a, Gangopadhyay2005, Altava-Ortiz2006, Barrera2007, Cannon2007, Matulla2007, Bliefernicht2007, Maurer2008, Wu2012, Marty2012, Teng2012, Horton2012, Yiou2014}. When the first European long reanalysis ERA-40 \citep{Uppala2005} became available, it took some years to see it used in AMs, but it finally also became popular for European users \citep {Willems2011b, JakobThemessl2011a, BenDaoud2011, Turco2011a, Franke2011, Pascual2012b, Schenk2012, Ribalaygua2013a, Osca2013, Radanovics2013, Martin2014b, Chardon2014, BenDaoud2016}. \citet{BenDaoud2009} analysed the impact of choosing NR-1 or ERA-40 in the AM developed by \citet{Bontron2004} and found no significant difference for the predictors considered. The more recent ERA-Interim \citep[ERA-INT, ][]{Dee2011a} was used by \cite{Raynaud2016b}, and MERRA was used by \citet{Vanvyve2015}.

In almost all of these research works, a single reanalysis was used. The choice is likely to be primarily driven by the ease of access and the availability of some datasets in the research units, along with the code able to read it. Indeed, it is often not a priority to use the last reanalysis dataset available if the benefit for AMs is not proven, as it requires efforts to acquire ever larger datasets and to adapt the code to read it. It likely explains why many authors stick with the first American or European dataset.

Some other use of the AM focus on the reconstruction of weather conditions in the Twentieth Century. Thus, they require reanalyses spanning this period, such as the Twentieth Century Reanalysis \citep[20CR][]{Compo2011} produced by NOAA \citep[for example,][]{Kuentz2015, Caillouet2016, Brigode2016}. 

To our knowledge, \citet{Dayon2015} made the most comprehensive comparison of the reanalyses in the AM so far. They compared NR-1, MERRA, ERA-INT and 20CR and noted that the choice of the reanalysis, even if crucial for future climate change, is a non-negligible source of uncertainty, and that it can even impact the performance of the method to a greater extent than the choice of the predictors. They concluded that "the substantial differences in downscaling results associated with reanalyses [...] suggests that the role of reanalyses should not be underestimated when evaluating the statistical downscaling method". The choice of the predictors was also found to vary from a dataset to another, in a way that the optimization of the method is likely to be reanalysis dependent and that using a single reanalysis might introduce a lack of robustness \citep{Dayon2015}.

Reanalysis datasets were compared in multiple studies (...), but mainly in terms of climatological properties. It is certainly important for AMs to use reanalyses with accurate climatological characteristics, and particularly a good homogeneity over the period covered. However, AMs are sensitive to daily variability, and their performance assessment is greatly influenced by heavy precipitation events. The impact of the reanalysis on the performance of the AM can not be directly deduced from climatological analyses and needs to be assessed within the method, which is the goal of the present work. Ten reanalyses were compared for seven AMs at 300 stations in Switzerland (Sect. \ref{sec:influence}). Additionally, the role of the dataset resolution (Sect. \ref{sec:analyzes}.\ref{sec:resolution}), the length of the archive (Sect. \ref{sec:analyzes}.\ref{sec:length}), and the use of different members from ensemble datasets (Sect. \ref{sec:analyzes}.\ref{sec:ensemble}) were investigated.


\section{Data and methods}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Reanalysis datasets}

The considered global atmospheric reanalysis datasets are briefly described hereafter and some of their characteristics are provided in Table \ref{table:datasets}. The common period to all datasets is 1981--2010. All reanalysis products are available at a 6-h time step, with some datasets or variables having higher temporal resolution. Only the 6-h time step is considered in the present work.


\subsubsection{NCEP Reanalysis I}

The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I \citep[NR-1,][]{Kalnay1996, Kistler2001} is the first global reanalysis product. It was made with a model frozen at the state-of-the-art of 1995 and by assimilating land surface, ship, aircraft, rawinsonde, and satellite data among others, after quality control. However, upper-air observations have a much larger influence on the analysis than the surface observations \citep{Kistler2001}. The data assimilation system is a 3D variational technique (3D-Var). The model resolution is T62 (about 210~km) with 28 sigma vertical levels. All major physical processes are parameterized. The period coverage was starting first in 1957, before being extended to 1948. \citet{Kalnay1996} were aware that assimilating all available data at a give time would have impact on the climate of the reanalysis due to changes in the observating system, but the choice was made for accuracy over stability of the climate. A comparison of two sets of analyses made with and without the use of satellite data showed that even without satellite data, almost 100\% of the daily variance of the geopotential height was explained in the NH extratropics \citep{Kalnay1996}. Lower correlation values were found in other regions of the globe, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, where the uncertainty is much higher due to the lack of rawinsonde data. However, rms of the analysis increments (difference between the forecast and the analysis) at 500~hPa showed large differences between a data-poor year (1958) and a data-rich year (1996), and the climatologies before and after 1979 differ significantly due to the use of satellite data \citep{Kistler2001}.


\subsubsection{NCEP Reanalysis II}

The NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 \citep[NR-2,][]{Kanamitsu2002} is a follow-on to the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I project with the goal to correct known problems that were identified after the NR-1 production, mainly human processing errors. However. these issues have consequences for a limited number of applications. NR-2 also relies on updated versions of the assimilation system and the model, with improvements to the model physics. Changes in parameterizations have improved the precipitation estimate, but may have caused deterioration of other variables \citep{Kistler2001, Kanamitsu2002}. Primary analysis variables, such as geopotential heights, only contains minor differences with NR-1.

The model and the outputs have the same spatial and temporal resolution as NR-1, and it relies on mostly the same observational data.


\subsubsection{ERA-Interim}

ERA-Interim \citep[ERA-INT, ][]{Dee2011a} is produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and covers the period from 1979 onwards. It replaced ERA-40 \citep{Uppala2005}, which replaced ERA-15 \citep{Gibson1997}, reanalysis datasets of 45 and 15 years respectively. ERA-INT aims at addressing problems in data assimilation of ERA-40 and at improving several technical aspects in the process, which are expected to have an impact on the quality of the product.

ERA-INT uses a 4D variational technique (4D-Var) with sequential data assimilation in 12-hourly analysis cycles. It assimilates conventional observations, rawinsonde, aircraft, and satellite data, etc. 4D-Var is expected to make a more effective use of observations \citep{Dee2011a}. ERA-INT also relies on several bias and error correction techniques that were introduced after ERA-40 in order to minimise inconsistencies between observations of different types.

The atmospheric model uses a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordinate on 60 layers and has a T255 horizontal resolution (about 79~km) and a 30~min time step. Orographic effects and convection schemes, among others, have been improved since ERA-40.


\subsubsection{Climate Forecast System Reanalysis}

The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis \citep[CFSR, ][]{Saha2010a} is the second generation of global reanalyses provided by NCEP. The model resolution was significantly increased since NR-1/NR-2 : horizontal resolution of T382 (about 38~km) and 64 vertical levels on sigma-pressure hybrid vertical coordinates. Both the model and the assimilation were also improved. New parameterizations were used, resulting in more realistic moisture prediction and mountain blocking representation, among others \citep{Saha2010a}. There is also a coupling to the ocean and a sea ice model. Temperature, moisture, and ozone fields are also better adjusted to best match the observed radiances.

CFSR has the particularity to analyze the historical tropical storm locations. The substantial benefit is that "by relocating a tropical storm vortex to its observed location prior to the assimilation of storm circulation observations, distortion of the circulation by the mismatch of guess and observed locations is avoided" \citep{Saha2010a}. This aspect can have significant impact on analogue methods using geopotential heights as predictors in certain regions of the world.

The assimilation scheme relies on the 3D-Var technique, but with a certain consideration of the time aspect by using time tendencies of state variables. The analysis system used in CFSR for the atmosphere is similar to the one used by MERRA, with nearly the same input data. The assimilated data are most of available observations from different kind of sensors, selected after quality control. The period covered is from 1979 onwards, but the initial plan was to extend it back to 1947 or earlier \citep{Saha2010a}.


\subsubsection{Japanese 55-year Reanalysis}

The Japanese 55-year Reanalysis \citep[JRA-55, ][]{Kobayashi2015, Harada2016} is the second global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The datasets starts in 1958 is continued. It is based on the 4D-Var assimilation technique, which makes it the first one applying 4D-Var to this period. The forecast model used is a TL319 spectral resolution (about 60~km) version of the JMA global spectral model (GSM) with 60 vertical layers. The improvement in the forecast model and the assimilation, as well as the use of newly available and improved past observations have led to substantial improvements in the reanalysis quality since the first dataset (JRA-25) \citep{Kobayashi2015, Harada2016}. The observations used consist of those archived by JMA and those used in ERA-40 \citep{Uppala2005}. Tropical cyclones data were also assimilated, which results in a good representation of tropical cyclones in the dataset compared to other reanalyses \citep{Harada2016}. JRA-55 is still sensitive to changes in the observing networks for some characteristics, but far less than JRA-25 was, which is likely related to improvements in the forecast model providing greater physical consistency of the JRA-55 product \citep{Kobayashi2015}. JRA-55 aims at providing time-consistent data suitable for climate change studies \citep{Ebita2011}.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also released another product, JRA-55 Conventional \citep[JRA-55C,][]{Kobayashi2014}, a version of the reanalysis based on the assimilation of only conventional data and upper air observations, without any satellite observation. The dataset is thus more homogeneous as it is unaffected by changes in satellite observing systems, even though the time variation of the number of observations may also have an impact. The data assimilation system and the boundary conditions remains identical to the ones used in JRA-55. JRA-55C starts in 1972; the full 55-years datasets is obtained by using outputs from JRA-55 prior to 1972. Geopotential heights at 500~hPa were found to present very small differences in the extra-tropics in the Northern Hemisphere. These differences are more important for the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the anomaly  of geopotential heights are highly correlated between both datasets, except where conventional observations are sparse, especially for high latitude areas of the SH (60\degree S−90\degree S). Precipitation, which provides an integrated evaluation of the performances of the assimilation system, was found to be more consistent with observations in some analyzed regions for JRA-55 and JRA-55C than for JRA-25 and ERA-INT.


\subsubsection{NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis}

The Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 2c \citep[20CR-2c, ][]{Compo2011} produced by NOAA is the longest dataset available, starting in 1851. Unlike the other reanalysis datasets that assimilate as much data as possible, it only assimilates surface pressure data and relies on observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. The assimilation technique used is an Ensemble Kalman Filter that allows to take into account the time-varying observations uncertainty related to the evolution of the measuring networks. The atmospheric model used is the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) with a T62 horizontal resolution and 28 vertical hybrid sigma-pressure levels. The datasets contains 56 members and also provides an ensemble mean. As expected, the ensemble uncertainty varies with the time-changing observation network, i.e. it decreases over time. The outputs are available with a 2\degree\ resolution on 24 pressure levels (for the ensemble mean -- less levels are publicly available for the individual members).

Although 20CR-2c only relies on surface data, it was found to have relevant information of the state of the atmosphere at higher levels, such as the 500~hPa geopotential height and the 850~hPa air temperature \citep{Compo2011}. Thanks to the consideration of the evolving observation uncertainty in the Kalman Filter, 20CR-2c was found to be more skilful that ERA-40 (predecessor of ERA-interim) for the prediction of the 300~hPa geopotential height in the Southern Hemisphere prior to the satellite era. Statistics of storm tracks and some climate indices were also found to be relevant \citep{Compo2011}.


\subsubsection{ECMWF 20th Century Reanalysis}

The ECMWF twentieth century reanalysis \citep[ERA-20C, ][]{Poli2016} starts in 1900, which makes it the second longest dataset after 20CR-2c. ERA-20C also assimilates surface pressure, but additionally assimilates marine wind observations. Unlike 20CR-2c it is single-member. It is forced by sea surface temperature, sea ice cover, atmospheric composition changes, and solar forcing. The atmospheric model used is the ECMWF’s Integrated Forecast System (IFS) with a time step of 30 min, a T159 resolution (approximately 125 km), and 91 levels. The assimilation technique is 4D-Var on a 24~h window, which is also able to account for spatially and temporally varying errors in the model and the observations, as in 20CR-2c. A previously produced 10-member ensemble was used to derive these errors estimates.

When analysing the total column water vapor output, \citet{Poli2016} found that ERA-20C and 20CR-2c had dry biases but better reproduced anomalies than JRA-55 or ERA-INT. Despite some differences, climate indices are in reasonable agreement between reanalysis datasets.


\subsubsection{MERRA-2}

The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2  \citep[MERRA-2, ][]{Gelaro2017} is an improvement for the first MERRA reanalysis \citep{Rienecker2011} produced by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). One of the main objective of NASA's GMAO reanalysis projects is to improve the hydrological cycle represented in reanalysis products, primarily by providing improvement in precipitation and water vapor climatology.

MERRA-2 relies on assimilation of additional satellite observations, including deduced surface wind speeds and vectors. An important improvement is that shows a reduction of biases and imbalances in the water cycle, and the reduction of discontinuities in precipitation related to changes in the observing system \citep{Gelaro2017}. The atmospheric model has also improved both in its dynamical core and its physical parameterizations since the first version of MERRA. New bias corrections schemes were implemented too.

A particularity of MERRA-2 compared to the other datasets considered in the present work is that it uses a finite-volume dynamical core with a cubed-sphere horizontal discretization rather than a spectral model. The model grid has a relatively uniform resolution of 0.5\degree x 0.625\degree and 72 vertical levels. The analysis uses the 3D-Var technique with a 6-h update cycle, at the same resolution as the atmospheric model. The quality control procedure was changed in order to allow for larger observation values (outliers) of to be preserved, for surface pressure and other variables.


\subsubsection{ECMWF Coupled 20th Century Reanalysis}

The ECMWF coupled twentieth century reanalysis (CERA-20C) is a follow-up of ERA-20C, with an additional coupling to the ocean. The additional assimilated data are ocean temperature and salinity profiles. The coupled data assimilation system is able to take into account feedbacks between the ocean and atmosphere in the forecast as well as the analysis step \citep{Laloyaux2016}. This ensures a physical consistency between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere. The positive impact of the coupling on temperatures was found to be limited for the atmosphere, but more important for the ocean \citep{Laloyaux2016}. Changes in the atmosphere temperature are located near the ocean surface, but there is no impact for the upper atmosphere. The coupled system has shown a neutral impact for geopotential heights or wind speeds \citep{Laloyaux2016}. 

CERA-20C is an ensemble dataset containing 10 members and spanning the period 1901--2010.



\subsection{Precipitation dataset}
\label{sec:precip}

The predictands -- variables to be predicted -- considered here are daily precipitation totals (06:00 h UTC to 06:00 h UTC the following day) at 301 weather stations of the MeteoSwiss network in Switzerland (Fig. \ref{fig:stations}). All stations with a good data record over the period 1981--2010 were considered. Often, applications of analogue methods rely on gridded precipitation or catchment-scale aggregated series, but any data manipulation were avoided here in order to obviate any undesired interference with the sensitivity analysis. The precipitation data were not transformed by a square root like in some other studies. Thirty stations -- those with longer time series -- were selected among this selection for additional analyses (Sect. \ref{sec:analyzes}).

The 30-year precipitation dataset was divided into a calibration period (CP) and an independent validation period (VP). In order to reduce the impact of potential inhomogeneities in the time series, the selection of the VP was evenly distributed over the entire series \citep{BenDaoud2010}. A total of 6 years was considered for the VP by selecting 1 out of every 5 years. Days from the VP were never used as candidate situations for the selection of analogues.


\subsection{Considered analogue methods}
\label{sec:ams}

Different variants of the analogue method were considered in the present work (Table \ref{table:methods}). These methods have a varying complexity and are constituted of a single or multiple subsequent levels of analogy with predictor variables of different kind. A relatively simple method that is often considered as reference is based on the analogy of synoptic circulation on two geopotential heights (Z1000 at 12:00 h UTC and Z500 at 24 h UTC) and is named here 2Z.

The 2Z method consists of the following steps: first, to cope with seasonal effects, candidate dates are extracted within a period of four months centred around the target date, for every year of the archive (PC: preselection on calendar basis in Table \ref{table:methods}). Then, the similarity of the atmospheric circulation of a target date with every day of the archive is assessed by processing the S1 criterion \citep[Eq.\ \ref{eq:S1}, ][]{Teweles1954, Drosdowsky2003}, which is a comparison of gradients, over a certain spatial window (domain on which the predictors are compared):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:S1}
S1=100 \frac {\displaystyle \sum_{i} \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} - \Delta z_{i} \vert}
{\displaystyle \sum_{i} max\left\lbrace \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} \vert , \vert \Delta z_{i} \vert \right\rbrace }
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \hat{z}_{i}$ is the difference in geopotential height between the \textit{i}-th pair of adjacent points of gridded data describing the target situation, and $\Delta z_{i}$ is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation. The smaller the S1 values, the more similar the pressure fields. This criteria being processed on gradients, it is not sensitive to biases in the considered dataset, as long as the circulation is correctly represented. \citet{Bontron2004} showed that the S1 criterion performs better than scores based on absolute distances, as it compares the circulation patterns rather than the absolute value of the geopotential height. 

The $N_{1}$ dates with the lowest values of S1 are considered as analogues to the target day. The number of analogues, $N_{1}$, is a parameter to calibrate. Then, the daily observed precipitation amount for the $N_{1}$ selected dates provide the empirical conditional distribution, considered as the probabilistic prediction for the target day. The choice of the predictors and their corresponding pressure levels and temporal windows were optimized for the NR-1 dataset \citep{Bontron2004}.

A variation of the former method, but based on the mean sea level pressure (2SLP) rather than geopotential heights was also assessed in this work. The S1 criteria was also used to quantify the analogy between the pressure fields. SLP was used in AMs by \citet{Zorita1999}, \citet{Timbal2001a} and \citet{Martin2014b} amongst others.

Another method relying only on the atmospheric circulation has also been considered. It relies on four geopotential heights (4Z, Table \ref{table:methods}) that were automatically selected by genetic algorithms for the upper Rhone catchment in Switzerland \citep{Horton2017b}. The 4Z method was shown to significantly outperform the 2Z method by exploiting more information from the geopotential heights and by taking advantage of additional degrees of freedom, such as different spatial windows between the pressure levels and the introduction of a weighting between them. However, due to the high number of datasets and stations considered in this work, it was not possible to use genetic algorithms in order to optimize the method. Thus, the 4Z method considered here is a simplification of the results from \citet{Horton2017b}, and only the selection of the optimal pressure levels and temporal windows were considered (Z1000 at 06:00 and 30:00 h UTC, Z700 at 24:00 h UTC, and Z500 at 12:00 h UTC), and fixed for all stations. As for the 2Z method, a unique but station-specific spatial window for all pressure level was considered, and the weights between the pressure levels have equal values. Such simplifications of the parameters resulted in a decrease of the performance score, which however was still superior to the one of the 2Z method.

The other methods considered hereafter add a second, or more, subsequent level(s) of analogy after the analogy of the atmospheric circulation. Unlike stated in \citet{Caillouet2016}, stepwise analogue methods existed for some time \citep[e.g.][]{Bontron2004, Bontron2005, Marty2010, Marty2012, Horton2012a}. The next parametrization adds a second level of analogy on the moisture variables (method 2Z-2MI, Table \ref{table:methods}). The predictor that \citet{Bontron2004} found optimal for France is a moisture index (MI) made of the product of the total precipitable water (TPW) with the relative humidity at 850~hPa (RH850). \cite{Horton2012a} confirmed that this index is also better for the Swiss Alps than any other variable from the NR-1 considered independently. When adding a second level of analogy, $N_{2}$ dates are subsampled within the $N_{1}$ analogues of the atmospheric circulation, to end up with a smaller number of analogue situations. When this second level of analogy is added, a higher number of analogues $N_{1}$ is kept on the first level. 

Similarly to the 4Z method, the 4Z-2MI is a simplification of the methods optimized by genetic algorithms in \citet{Horton2017b}. It consists of a first level of analog on four geopotential heights (Z1000 at 30:00 h UTC, Z850 at 12:00 h UTC, Z700 at 24:00 h UTC, and Z400 at 12:00 h UTC) followed by the moisture index (MI) at two pressure levels (MI700 at 24:00 h UTC and MI600 at 12:00 h UTC).

\citet{BenDaoud2016} replaced the calendar preselection ($\pm$ 60 days around the target date) by a preselection on similar air temperature (T925 at 36:00 h UTC and T600 at 12:00 h UTC, at the nearest grid point). It allows a more dynamic screening of similar situations in terms of air masses as the seasonal signal is also present in the temperature data. The undesired mixing of spring and autumn situations is discussed in \citet{Caillouet2016}. The number of preselected dates ($N_{0}$) is equivalent to the number of days one would have chosen with the calendar approach, and thus depends on the archive size: $N_{0} = 120 \cdot n_{a}$ where $n_{a}$ is the number of years in the calibration period. In this method, named PT-2Z-4MI, the analogy of the atmospheric circulation is the same as in the 2Z method, but the moisture analogy differs (MI925 and MI700 at 12:00 and 24:00 h UTC).

Subsequently, \citet{BenDaoud2016} added an additional level of analogy between the circulation and the moisture analogy (PT-2Z-4W-4MI, Table \ref{table:methods}) based on vertical velocity at 850~hPa (W850). This AM was primarily developed for large floodplains in France (Sa\^{o}ne, Seine) and is the most complex method considered in this work. 

AMs rely on parameters that need to be defined for every level of analogy. In this work, the choice of the predictors and their corresponding temporal windows (hour of the day) was identical to the listed methods in Table \ref{table:methods} and were not reassessed. The parameters that were here calibrated for every station, method, and dataset, are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The spatial windows, which are the domains on which the predictors are compared. A spatial window is specific to each level of analogy and is here shared between all the predictors of that level.
	\item The optimal number of analogue situations to sample for every level of analogy.
\end{itemize}

The semi-automatic sequential procedure developed by \citet{Bontron2004} was used to calibrate the AM. The procedure used is described in \citet{Horton2017c} and is similar to the work of \citet{Radanovics2013} and \citet{BenDaoud2016}. It was implemented in the open source AtmoSwing-optimizer software v1.5.0 \citep[www.atmoswing.org,][]{Horton2017a}, which was used to perform the calibration.

Precipitation variables from reanalyses are generally not considered as predictors, as they strongly depend on the model physics \citep{Rienecker2011} and are characterized by important biases, which would make the method non-transposable to the outputs of another model. \citet{Dayon2015} assessed the relevance of using precipitation from four reanalyses as predictors. This resulted in downscaled precipitation with high correlation with the observations for MERRA, but the related biases were much larger than for other predictors. Their analyses conducted them to reject precipitation as a predictor.


\subsection{Performance assessment}

The CRPS \citep[Continuous Ranked Probability Score,][]{Brown1974, Matheson1976, Hersbach2000} is often used to assess the performance of AMs. It allows evaluating the predicted cumulative distribution functions $F(y)$, for example, of the precipitation values $y$ associated with the analogue situations, compared to the single observed value $y^{0}$. The better the prediction, the smaller the score.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CRPS}
CRPS = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \left[ F_{i}(y)-H_{i}(y-y_{i}^{0})\right]^{2} dy
\end{equation}
where $H(y-y_{i}^{0})$ is the Heaviside function that is null when $y-y_{i}^{0}<0$, and has the value 1 otherwise.

In order to compare the value of the score relative to a reference, one often considers its skill score expression, and uses the climatological distribution of precipitation from the entire archive as the reference. However, the choice of the reference is not important when comparing performances, since we consider its increase or decrease rather than the CRPSS absolute value. The CRPSS (Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score) is thus defined as follows \citep{Bradley2011}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CRPSS}
CRPSS = 1-\frac{\overline{CRPS}}{\overline{CRPS}_{clim}}
\end{equation}
where $CRPS_{clim}$ is the CRPS value for the climatology. A better prediction is characterized by an increase in CRPSS.

\section{Influence of the reanalysis dataset}
\label{sec:influence}

All considered AMs were calibrated for every dataset and station, which resulted in a total of 21,070 runs processed on a HPC cluster at the University of Bern. For every combination, the spatial windows and the number of analogues of each analogy level were optimized with a semi-automatic sequential procedure (Sect. \ref{sec:data}\ref{sec:ams}). Thus, the parameters were independent for any configuration, and the number of analogues was always optimal. All results are shown for the VP (validation period, Sect. \ref{sec:data}\ref{sec:precip}), and are thus not due to over-parameterization. The scores processed on the CP (calibration period) were similar. The original resolutions of the reanalysis datasets were used and thus differ from one to to other. Impact of the resolution is analyzed in Sect. \ref{sec:analyzes}.\ref{sec:resolution}.

The results of 20CR-2c are shown for the ensemble mean only. The same analyzes were performed on a single member (the first one), but no significant difference has been observed. The single-member might be slightly less skillful than the ensemble mean, but only by a small amount (not shown).


\subsection{Mean performance}

The performances (CRPSS score) of all considered AMs and reanalysis datasets are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_values}. Overall, the skill of the AMs tend to increase with their complexity. The two first methods based on two circulation predictors, 2SLP and 2Z, are equivalent, except for MERRA-2, where SLP show a higher predictive skill than Z. Then, there is a systematic increase of the skill when selecting 2Z, 4Z, 2Z-2MI, or 4Z-2MI. Finally, the respective performance of the 4Z-2MI, PT-2Z-4MI and the PT-2Z-4W-4MI methods vary from one dataset to another. Thus, an increase in complexity of the AM can only be justified for some datasets.

The effect of the reanalysis dataset was isolated in Figure \ref{fig:comparison_relative} by processing the difference in CRPSS for one dataset compared to the mean performance on all datasets, per station and per method. The variability is reduced because the climatological differences between the stations were mostly removed. There is a tendency for the impact of the dataset to increase with the complexity of the method. This is particularly visible for JRA-55, JRA-55C and 20CR-2c. The relative performance of 20CR-2c significantly decreases for more complex methods, even though the absolute skill score generally increases (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_values}). The 2SLP method was found to be particularly skillful with MERRA-2 compared to other datasets. 

The 301 precipitation stations are located at different elevations and are subject to various meteorological influences. In order to analyze spatial patterns of the methods vs. datasets relationship, maps of the best method per dataset are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:map_best_methods}. The selection of the optimal method was previously shown to vary with the dataset. One can now also see that it is not equivalent for all stations, but there are spatial patterns depending on the local climate. The three most complex methods (4Z-2MI, PT-2Z-4MI, and PT-2Z-4W-4MI) are almost always selected. The PT-2Z-4MI and PT-2Z-4W-4MI methods were developed for a context of large flood plains, and 4Z-2MI in the context of the upper Rhone catchment in Switzerland. There is a tendency in these maps for the methods to be selected as optimal in their original context, respectively the Plateau or the Alps. Moreover, the fact that a variable such as vertical velocity is considered at a low resolution (0.5\degree -- 2.5\degree) may still make sense in large plains as an uplift/subsidence index, but may be less relevant in narrow alpine valleys. 

The variability between the maps is likely related to the predictive skill of the variables from the different datasets. Vertical velocity seems to be overall not optimal in 20CR-2c, but preferable in JRA-55(C) and ERA-20C, which is consistent with Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_values}. The choice of the dataset and the AM should then take into account the context of the area of interest.


\subsection{Performance for different precipitation thresholds}

The impact of the reanalysis dataset was previously analyzed in terms of mean performance, for all days, let they be dry or characterized by extreme precipitation. However, the dynamism of the synoptic situation can differ significantly between these situations. High precipitation events are expected to be related to more dynamic systems in average. Thus, the impact of the reanalysis dataset was assessed for different precipitation thresholds.

First, the impact of the reanalysis dataset was isolated for dry days (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative_P0}). Globally, the hierarchy of the datasets is preserved, and the scale of the impact on the CRPSS is reduced, due to generally lower CRPS values related to dry days. Among the biggest changes, the performance of 20CR-2c for AMs based on the atmospheric circulation has increased to the level of other datasets, which is not the case when moisture variables are used. MERRA-2 has in average the largest positive influence, even though its impact on the 2SLP method is here not different to other datasets.

Different thresholds for high precipitation were assessed and provide similar results. Figure \ref{fig:comparison_relative_Pq95} show the impact of the dataset for target days with precipitation above the 95th all days percentile. The hierarchy between the datasets is similar to the all days situations (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}), with some nuances. JRA-55 and JRA-55C are in average superior to the others. The positive impact of MERRA-2 on the 2SLP method is thus clearly related to days with precipitation, which are expected to be more dynamic.


\subsection{Selection of the analogue dates}

The use of a certain dataset over another has an influence on the selection of the analogue days. These selections were compared between datasets for all stations and all AMs. Figure \ref{fig:similarities_analogue_dates} shows the percentage of similar analogue dates selected when using the reanalysis datasets in columns that are also found when using the datasets in rows for different AMs. The values are averaged for all stations on the VP (same results on the CP). One should remember that the methods were calibrated for all stations and all datasets independently, and thus the spatial windows on which the predictors are compared might not correspond, neither the number of analogues.

As expected, more complex AMs show lower percentages of similar analogue days between the datasets. Indeed, higher correspondence is expected for circulation variables than moisture variables, which are more model-dependent. Reanalysis datasets that are close products, such as NR-1 and NR-2 or JRA-55 and JRA-55C, show the highest similarity. However, differences still exist although these datasets perform almost equally well (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}). Higher similarities can also be observed between CERA-20C and ERA-20C.

20CR-2c differs the most from other datasets for all methods. This difference in the selection of analogue days leads to lower performance of the methods (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}). However, this difference is less present row-wise. It is due to the selection of a higher number of analogues for 20CR-2c: this selection being larger, it is easier to find matching dates from other datasets with a lower number of analogues than the opposite. Another noticeable difference is for MERRA-2 and the 2SLP method. In this case, this difference leads to better performance score (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}). The selection based on JRA-55 and JRA-55C have globally the highest correspondence to the other datasets.


\section{Further analyzes}
\label{sec:analyzes}

\subsection{Influence of the spatial resolution}
\label{sec:resolution}

The different reanalysis datasets are characterized by various grid resolutions. In order to assess the role of the resolution in the relative performance of the methods, the datasets with the higher resolution were degraded to increasingly lower resolutions. For each resolution, the parameters of the AMs were calibrated again, independently for every method, dataset and station, and are thus optimal for a given configuration. The impact of the resolution degradation is presented in Figure \ref{fig:plot_impact_resolution} for six AMs. The values are averaged on a selection of 30 stations (Fig. \ref{fig:stations}). First, except for 2SLP with MERRA-2, using a resolution below 1\degree\ do not provide higher performance. There are two possible reasons for such result: first, the AMs might not be sensitive to small scale variability, as the analogy of features at 1\degree\ is sufficient to describe the situation; or, the small-scale information contained in the datasets is not relevant. A mean increase in performance might be observed when using a 1\degree\ (or 1.25\degree) instead of a 0.5\degree\ (or 0.625\degree) resolution. It must first be noted that this increase is not systematic for every station, and that some variability was observed. Thus, it might not be highly reliable. However, if such increase would be confirmed in a larger selection of stations, it might highlight some small-scale variability that is detrimental to the AM. The exception of SLP from MERRA-2 being more relevant at a higher resolution would suggest that this variable contains relevant information at a small scale, which partly explains its mean higher performance (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}), and in particular a better description of the more dynamic situations related to high precipitation events (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative_Pq99}).

Beyond 1\degree, the decrease in performance is systematic, but not of the same magnitude for every dataset and method. As expected, methods relying on Z are less sensitive to the resolution than the ones with moisture variables. With no surprise, the most complex method, PT-2Z-4VV-4MI is the most sensitive to the resolution as it relies on more local information. The 4Z method is the less sensitive, also when compared to 2Z. This might be due to more informative variables on the atmospheric circulation as it relies on more fields of the geopotential height. For this method, even a reduction of the resolution to 2\degree\ has limited to no impact.


\subsection{Archive length}
\label{sec:length}

All previous comparisons take place on the period 1981--2010. However, some datasets have the important added value of covering longer periods. Longer datasets have mainly two benefits: they allow working on past periods as target, for example to reconstruct the meteorological conditions linked to a flood event, and they enrich the pool of potential analogue situations primarily for less frequent situations. This second aspect is the focus of the present analysis. 

The different AMs were then recalibrated on the same CP as previously and assessed on the same VP, but with an increasing archive, which constituted the pool of potential analogue situations, by adding dates farther in the past, back to 1871 (for 20CR-2c). The influence of the archive's length is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:plot_impact_length} for five AMs and the NR-R1, JRA-55, CERA-20C, and 20CR-2c datasets, on the 30 stations with longer time series available (Sect. \ref{sec:data}\ref{sec:precip}). When adding 10 or 20 years of archive, all the methods gain in performance in a relatively similar way for the different datasets. Divergences appear when increasing further the size of the archive by adding data from further in the past. The gains of longer archives for methods based on the atmospheric circulation only (2Z and 4Z, panel a) is superior to other methods with multiple levels of analogy, and tend to continue growing for 4Z. When adding the years 1871--1881 of 20CR-2c, a small loss of performance can be observed for all methods but the 4Z method. Additionally, the increase in performance flatters for more complex methods with 20CR-2c data before 1921. For CERA-20C, the increase in performance also flatters with data before 1921 for 2Z, 4Z and 4Z-2MI. For more complex AMs, CERA-20C data before 1941 or 1961 lead to reduced improvement or loss in performance.

With perfect predictor and predictand (precipitation) archives, the prediction skill of the different methods would only increase thanks to the enrichment of the pool of potential analogues. A decrease in performance can be explained by the presence of less good analogues that degrade the prediction. The presence of less good analogues can be due to (a) a relationship between predictors and predictand that is not preserved between the two periods, (b) a precipitation archive with errors for the past period, or (c) reanalysis datasets with errors on their early years. While it is obvious that the quality of precipitation measurement is not constant over time, and that the climate system presents a certain variability, a break in performance would appear at the same period for all datasets and eventually methods. The presence of breaks at different years that are dataset and method dependent would suggest that the variability in the predictors quality is likely the leading factor. From this perspective, it is not surprising that methods based on geopotential heights only are more robust, as this predictor is well predicted by the models, and for 20CR-2c only pressure data are assimilated. Thus, for periods where measurements were scarce, the models were less constrained to observations and predictors such as moisture, temperature and vertical velocity are more uncertain. 


\subsection{Ensembles datasets}
\label{sec:ensemble}

As discussed in the previous section, the datasets spanning over a century are more uncertain for the early period. In order to take into account this uncertainty, the CERA-20C and the 20CR-2c datasets provide 10 and 56 members respectively. These ensemble datasets can be used in the analogue method by looking for similar days on every member. Both the target and the candidate situations are thus extracted from the same member and the identified analogue days are gathered in a single selection. Two options are then possible : (a) to keep all dates, including the duplicates, or (b) to keep only once a date, by removing duplicates. For both options the optimal number of analogues needs to be reassessed. If the data from the different members were exactly identical, the optimized number of analogues of the first approach would be $m$ times higher as the selection on a single member, $m$ being the number of members considered. On the contrary, the number of analogues would not change for the second approach. Both approaches were assessed for the methods 2Z and 2Z-2MI, because their predictors were also available for 20CR-2c. As the spread is lower for the present and higher in the past, two periods were assessed: 1901--1930 and 1981--2010.










\section{Discussion}



Perspective with ERA-5


"MJO signals in JRA-55 (Fig. 8a) and ERA-Interim (Fig. 8d) are stronger than in the other reanalyses and are closer to those in the NOAA OLR" \cite{Harada2016}



"20CR generally leads to smaller correlations, when local processes, not as well constrained in 20CR, are important for precipitation. Yet, given the breadth of data assimilated by the other reanalyses compared to 20CR, the relatively good performance obtained with 20CR is noteworthy, as this reanalysis has the advantage to be available on a much longer period" \cite{Dayon2015}




"Very interestingly, TTI and HUS as predictors were not associated with large differences in downscal- ing results during summer in the present climate (for example, compare the results of C6, C5, and C4 in Figure 2). These variables however lead to large differences in terms of future climate change signals, as shown with the perfect model framework. This is an illustration of the limitation of classical approaches for the evaluation of downscaling methods based only on present-day observations. It is also interesting to note that the lowest interannual present-day correlations between downscaled precipitation and obser- vations were found in summer. Despite that, Figure 7 show that summer changes are especially well captured. It is another illustration that present-day performances are not necessarily a very good indicator of performances in the climate change context." \citep{Dayon2015}

"A forecast model serves to propagate information of observations in time and place, and therefore its perfor- mance has a considerable impact on the quality of a reanalysis" \citep{Kobayashi2015}.

"that historical changes of observing systems cause inhomogeneities in these reanalyses that have discouraged use of the reanalyses to detect and examine climate variations and climate trends".
"variability on multi-year timescales (especially decadal) is not estimated very well in the reanalyses." 
\citep{Kobayashi2014}.
